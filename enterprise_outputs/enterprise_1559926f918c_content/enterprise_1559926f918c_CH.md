                            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> 1. **Quantifying Intangible Benefits**: Many AI solutions provide intangible benefits, such as improved efficiency, better decision-making, or enhanced customer satisfaction, which can be challenging to quantify in monetary terms.
2. **Attribution of Revenue**: In complex business environments, attributing revenue directly to AI solutions can be difficult, especially when AI is one of many factors influencing business outcomes.
3. 🧠 Realize this: ✅ **High Development Costs**: The development and implementation of AI solutions can be costly, including data preparation, model development, and integration with existing systems, which can impact the perceived ROI.
