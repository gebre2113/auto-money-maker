| Currency | 24-Month ROI | Annualized ROI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NO Currency | 124.5% | 6.4% |
| USD | 73.2% | 3.5% |

Based on this revenue modeling exercise, the NO currency investment portfolio has a significantly higher ROI than the USD investment portfolio, both in terms of total return and annualized ROI. This highlights the potential benefits of investing in NO currency.
