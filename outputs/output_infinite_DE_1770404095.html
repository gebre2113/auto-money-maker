            **Phase 2: Global Digital Dominance - The 2026 DE Strategy**

**Introduction**

In Phase 1 of our Digital Enterprise (DE) strategy, we laid the foundation for a global digital transformation by establishing a robust vision, strategy, and roadmap for success. Our organization is now poised to take the next significant step towards achieving global digital dominance. This Phase 2 document outlines the technical architecture, infrastructure setup, and local resource scaling that will enable us to achieve this ambitious goal.

**Technical Architecture**

Our technical architecture will be designed to support a hybrid cloud infrastructure, leveraging the strengths of both on-premises and cloud-based environments. This approach will provide flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, allowing us to adapt to changing business needs.

### **Cloud Strategy**

Our cloud strategy will be built around a multi-cloud approach, with a primary focus on:

* **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: For its scalability, reliability, and extensive library of services.
* **Microsoft Azure**: For its strong security features, AI capabilities, and seamless integration with Microsoft products.
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: For its cutting-edge AI and ML capabilities, as well as its commitment to sustainability.

### **Infrastructure Setup**

Our infrastructure setup will consist of the following key components:

* **Compute**: Virtual machines (VMs) and containers will be used to deploy applications, with a focus on serverless computing for stateless workloads.
* **Storage**: Distributed object storage will be used for large-scale data storage, with a focus on AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and GCP Cloud Storage.
* **Networking**: Software-defined networking (SDN) will be used to manage and optimize network traffic, with a focus on AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network, and GCP Virtual Network.
* **Security**: A zero-trust architecture will be implemented, with a focus on identity and access management (IAM), encryption, and intrusion detection.

### **Local Resource Scaling**

Our local resource scaling strategy will focus on the following key areas:

* **Capacity Planning**: Regular capacity planning exercises will be conducted to ensure that our infrastructure is adequately sized to meet business needs.
* **Resource Allocation**: Resources will be allocated based on business priority, with a focus on maximizing resource utilization and minimizing waste.
* **Cloud Cost Optimization**: Cloud cost optimization will be achieved through the use of cloud cost analytics tools, reserved instances, and spot instances.

**Implementation Roadmap**

The following implementation roadmap outlines the key milestones and timelines for Phase 2:

**Q1 2026**

* Finalize cloud strategy and select primary cloud providers
* Design and implement hybrid cloud architecture
* Deploy initial infrastructure components

**Q2 2026**

* Deploy remaining infrastructure components
* Implement local resource scaling strategy
* Begin migrating applications to cloud

**Q3 2026**

* Complete migration of applications to cloud
* Implement zero-trust architecture
* Conduct security and compliance audits

**Q4 2026**

* Finalize capacity planning and resource allocation
* Implement cloud cost optimization strategy
* Conduct performance and scalability testing

**Conclusion**

Phase 2 of our Digital Enterprise strategy marks a significant milestone in our journey towards global digital dominance. Our technical architecture, infrastructure setup, and local resource scaling strategies are designed to support a hybrid cloud infrastructure, provide flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, and enable us to adapt to changing business needs.
