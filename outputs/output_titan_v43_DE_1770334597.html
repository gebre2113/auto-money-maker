**ROI Modeling (Local Currency vs USD)**

Our ROI modeling is designed to estimate the return on investment (ROI) for our AI-driven digital wealth management solutions, taking into account both local currency and USD. We will use the following assumptions:

* **Local Currency**: Assume a 20% annual growth rate for the local currency.
* **USD**: Assume a 15% annual growth rate for USD.
* **Revenue Growth**: Assume a 25% annual revenue growth rate for the first three years, with a 10% annual revenue growth rate for the next three years.
* **Cost Savings**: Assume a 20% annual cost savings rate for the first three years, with a 10% annual cost savings rate for the next three years.

Using these assumptions, we estimate the following ROI:

| Year | Local Currency (LCY) | USD | Revenue Growth | Cost Savings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 100,000 | 80,000 | 25% | 20% |
| 2 | 125,000 | 100,000 | 25% | 20% |
| 3 | 156,250 | 125,000 | 10% | 10% |
| 4 | 171,875 | 140,000 | 10% | 10% |
| 5 | 188,500 | 156,000 | 10% | 10% |

Based on these estimates, we expect a minimum ROI of 25% in the first year, increasing to 30% in the second year, and 35% in the third year.
