Common techniques include listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, mean or median imputation, and regression imputation. Consider using multiple imputation techniques, such as multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), to create multiple versions of the dataset with different imputed values.</p>

<li><b>Q: What is the difference between a parametric and non-parametric test?</b>
<p>A: Parametric tests involve making assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, such as normality or equal variances. Non-parametric tests, on the other hand, do not require such assumptions, and are often used when the data do not meet the assumptions of parametric tests. Non-parametric tests can be more robust and flexible, but may also be less powerful than parametric tests.</p>

<li><b>Q: How do I choose the right evaluation metric for my model?</b>
<p>A: Choosing the right evaluation metric involves considering the specific goals and requirements of the project. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean squared error.
