**CHAPTER 2: Revenue Modeling: ROI in NO Currency vs USD**

Revenue modeling is a crucial step in understanding the potential returns on investment (ROI) in digital wealth. In this section, we will explore the concept of revenue modeling and how to calculate ROI in both NO currency and USD.

**Revenue Modeling**

Revenue modeling involves estimating the potential revenue streams from a digital wealth strategy. This includes identifying potential sources of revenue, estimating the value of each source, and calculating the total revenue.

**Calculating ROI in NO Currency**

To calculate ROI in NO currency, we need to follow these steps:

1. Estimate the revenue streams from the digital wealth strategy.
2. Calculate the total revenue in NO currency.
3. Calculate the expenses associated with the digital wealth strategy.
4. Calculate the net profit in NO currency.
5. Calculate the ROI in NO currency as a percentage.

**Calculating ROI in USD**

To calculate ROI in USD, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the revenue streams from NO currency to USD using the current exchange rate.
2. Calculate the total revenue in USD.
3. Calculate the expenses associated with the digital wealth strategy.
4. Calculate the net profit in USD.
5. Calculate the ROI in USD as a percentage.

**Example**

Let's assume we have a digital wealth strategy that generates revenue from the following sources:

* Cryptocurrency trading: 10% of total revenue
* Token sales: 20% of total revenue
* e-commerce sales: 30% of total revenue
* Partnerships and collaborations: 40% of total revenue

The total revenue from these sources is $100,000 in NO currency. The expenses associated with the digital wealth strategy are $20,000 in NO currency.

To calculate the ROI in NO currency, we can use the following formula:

ROI = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) x 100
= ($80,000 / $100,000) x 100
= 80%

To calculate the ROI in USD, we need to convert the revenue and expenses from NO currency to USD using the current exchange rate.

Assuming the current exchange rate is 1 NO = 0.01 USD, we can convert the revenue and expenses as follows:

Revenue: $100,000 NO = $1,000 USD
Expenses: $20,000 NO = $200 USD

The net profit in USD is $1,000 - $200 = $800.

To calculate the ROI in USD, we can use the following formula:

ROI = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) x 100
= ($800 / $1,000) x 100
= 80%
