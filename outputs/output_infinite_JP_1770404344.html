### Introduction

As the Chief Technical Officer of our organization, I am pleased to present Phase 2 of the Sovereign AI Wealth Engineering project in Japan. Our goal is to create a cutting-edge AI-powered wealth engineering platform that caters to the unique needs of Japanese investors. In this document, we will outline the technical architecture, infrastructure setup, and local resource scaling requirements for the project.

### Technical Architecture

Our technical architecture for the Sovereign AI Wealth Engineering platform is based on a microservices design, which allows for scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. The architecture consists of the following components:

#### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

* **Data Sources:** We will integrate with various data sources such as financial databases, market data feeds, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
* **Data Processing:** We will use Apache NiFi to ingest and process the data in real-time, using Apache Kafka as a message broker.
