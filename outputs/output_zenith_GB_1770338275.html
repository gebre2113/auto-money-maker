| Variable | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Base Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue Growth | 5% | 15% | 10% |
| Operating Expenses | 10% | 20% | 15% |
| Capital Expenditures | 5% | 15% | 10% |

3. **Break-Even Analysis**

We will conduct a break-even analysis to determine the point at which GB's revenue will cover its operating expenses.

| Revenue | Operating Expenses | Break-Even Point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $100,000 | $50,000 | $50,000 |
