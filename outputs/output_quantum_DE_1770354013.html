**Executive Summary**

This 24-month tactical roadmap outlines strategies and advanced ROI models for Wealth Engineering, a cutting-edge approach to Digital Estate (DE) management. The roadmap provides a comprehensive framework for maximizing returns on investment (ROI) in the digital space, ensuring long-term wealth preservation and growth.

**Month 1-3: Foundation and Planning**

### **Objective:** Establish a solid foundation for DE management and create a comprehensive wealth engineering plan.

#### **Tasks:**

1. **Conduct a thorough analysis** of the client's digital assets, including:
	* Social media profiles
	* Online presence (website, blog, etc.)
	* Digital identity (cryptocurrency, NFTs, etc.)
	* Digital legacy (passwords, encryption keys, etc.)
2. **Develop a unique value proposition (UVP)** for DE management, highlighting the benefits of wealth engineering.
3. **Create a comprehensive wealth engineering plan**, outlining:
	* Goals and objectives
	* Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
	* Investment and diversification strategies
	* Tax optimization and planning
4. **Establish key performance indicators (KPIs)** to measure progress and ROI.

### **ROI Model:**

#### **Digital Estate Index (DEI)**

The DEI measures the overall value of a client's digital assets, taking into account their online presence, digital identity, and legacy.

`DEI = (Online Presence Value + Digital Identity Value + Digital Legacy Value) / Total Digital Assets`

#### **Wealth Engineering Multiplier (WEM)**

The WEM calculates the potential ROI of wealth engineering services, based on the client's goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategies.

`WEM = (Goals Achieved / Risk Exposure) x (Investment Returns / Total Assets)`

### **Month 4-6: Asset Optimization and Protection**

#### **Objective:** Optimize and protect the client's digital assets to maximize ROI.

#### **Tasks:**

1. **Implement digital asset optimization strategies**, including:
	* Social media optimization
	* Online presence optimization
	* Digital identity management
2. **Develop a comprehensive digital asset protection plan**, including:
	* Password management
	* Encryption and backup strategies
	* Cybersecurity best practices
3. **Establish a digital estate review process**, to ensure ongoing optimization and protection.

### **ROI Model:**

#### **Digital Asset Value (DAV)**

The DAV measures the value of a client's digital assets, taking into account their online presence, digital identity, and legacy.

`DAV = (Online Presence Value + Digital Identity Value + Digital Legacy Value)`

#### **Risk Exposure Reduction (RER)**

The RER calculates the potential reduction in risk exposure, based on the client's digital asset protection plan.

`RER = (Risk Exposure Before Protection / Risk Exposure After Protection)`

### **Month 7-12: Investment and Diversification**

#### **Objective:** Invest and diversify the client's digital assets to maximize ROI.

#### **Tasks:**

1. **Develop an investment strategy** for the client's digital assets, including:
	* Cryptocurrency investment
	* NFT investment
	* Digital art investment
2. **Implement a diversification plan**, to spread risk and maximize returns.
3. **Establish a digital asset investment review process**, to ensure ongoing investment and diversification.

### **ROI Model:**

#### **Investment Returns (IR)**

The IR measures the returns on investment for the client's digital assets.

`IR = (Investment Value + Interest/Earnings) - (Investment Cost + Fees)`

#### **Diversification Ratio (DR)**

The DR calculates the potential diversification benefits, based on the client's investment and diversification strategy.

`DR = (Diversified Investment Value / Total Investment Value)`

### **Month 13-24: Tax Optimization and Legacy Planning**

#### **Objective:** Optimize taxes and plan the client's digital legacy.

#### **Tasks:**

1. **Develop a tax optimization plan**, to minimize tax liabilities and maximize returns.
2. **Create a digital legacy plan**, to ensure the client's digital assets are passed on to heirs.
3. **Establish a digital estate review process**, to ensure ongoing tax optimization and legacy planning.

### **ROI Model:**

#### **Tax Savings (TS)**

The TS measures the potential tax savings, based on the client's tax optimization plan.

`TS = (Tax Liability Before Optimization / Tax Liability After Optimization)`

#### **Legacy Value (LV)**

The LV measures the value of the client's digital legacy, taking into account their digital assets and estate plan.

`LV = (Digital Asset Value + Estate Value)`

### **Conclusion**

This 24-month tactical roadmap provides a comprehensive framework for maximizing returns on investment (ROI) in the digital space, ensuring long-term wealth preservation and growth. By implementing the strategies outlined in this roadmap, wealth engineers can help clients achieve their goals and maximize their digital estate value.
