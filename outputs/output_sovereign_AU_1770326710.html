4. **Advertising**: Displaying targeted advertising on the platform and charging advertisers for clicks or impressions.
5. **Data analytics**: Selling data analytics and insights to clients and third-party organizations.

**Revenue Model**

To develop a revenue model, we will use the following steps:

1. **Determine revenue streams**: Identify the revenue streams that are relevant to your business.
2. **Estimate revenue**: Estimate the revenue that each stream will generate.
3. **Calculate ROI**: Calculate the ROI for each stream using the following formula: ROI = (Revenue - Costs) / Costs.
4. **Compare ROI**: Compare the ROI of each stream to determine which stream is the most profitable.

**ROI in AU Currency (AUD)**

For the purpose of this example, we will assume that the estimated revenue for each stream is as follows:

1. **Trading fees**: $100,000 per month (AUD).
2. **Management fees**: $50,000 per month (AUD).
3. **Subscription fees**: $20,000 per month (AUD).
4. **Advertising**: $10,000 per month (AUD).
5. **Data analytics**: $5,000 per month (AUD).

Using the above estimates, we can calculate the ROI for each stream as follows:

1. **Trading fees**: ROI = (100,000 - 50,000) / 50,000 = 100% (AUD).
2. **Management fees**: ROI = (50,000 - 20,000) / 20,000 = 150% (AUD).
3. **Subscription fees**: ROI = (20,000 - 5,000) / 5,000 = 300% (AUD).
4. **Advertising**: ROI = (10,000 - 2,000) / 2,000 = 400% (AUD).
5. **Data analytics**: ROI = (5,000 - 1,000) / 1,000 = 500% (AUD).

**ROI in USD**

To calculate the ROI in USD, we need to convert the estimated revenue for each stream from AUD to USD. Assuming an exchange rate of 1 AUD = 0.70 USD, we can calculate the estimated revenue in USD as follows:

1. **Trading fees**: $70,000 per month (USD).
2. **Management fees**: $35,000 per month (USD).
3. **Subscription fees**: $14,000 per month (USD).
4. **Advertising**: $7,000 per month (USD).
5. **Data analytics**: $3,500 per month (USD).

Using the above estimates, we can calculate the ROI for each stream in USD as follows:

1. **Trading fees**: ROI = (70,000 - 35,000) / 35,000 = 100% (USD).
2. **Management fees**: ROI = (35,000 - 14,000) / 14,000 = 150% (USD).
3. **Subscription fees**: ROI = (14,000 - 3,500) / 3,500 = 300% (USD).
4. **Advertising**: ROI = (7,000 - 1,400) / 1,400 = 400% (USD).
5. **Data analytics**: ROI = (3,500 - 700) / 700 = 500% (USD).
