### Revenue Modeling (Local Currency)
Our revenue model is based on a combination of management fees and commission-based revenue streams. We anticipate generating revenue through:

* **Management fees**: 0.25% to 0.50% of assets under management (AUM) per annum
* **Commission-based revenue**: partnerships with financial institutions and product providers

Assuming an average AUM of $10,000 per customer, we project the following revenue growth:

Year 1: $1.25 million (25,000 customers)
Year 2: $5 million (100,000 customers)
Year 3: $15 million (300,000 customers)

### Risk
To mitigate risks, we will focus on the following areas:

* **Regulatory compliance**: ensuring adherence to relevant laws and regulations, such as the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
* **Cybersecurity**: implementing robust security measures to protect customer data and prevent unauthorized access
* **Market volatility**: diversifying investment portfolios and providing education resources to help customers navigate market fluctuations

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Probability | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Regulatory non-compliance | Regular audits and compliance reviews | Low | High |
| Cybersecurity breach | Implementing robust security measures and regular updates | Medium | High |
| Market volatility | Diversifying investment portfolios and education resources | High | Medium |

By following this 24-month roadmap, we aim to establish a strong presence in the US robo-advisory market, drive revenue growth, and provide a scalable platform for customers to achieve their financial goals.<hr><h2>Part 5: Mastery FAQ & Future</h2>
