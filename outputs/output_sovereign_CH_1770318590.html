**CHAPTER 2: REVENUE MODELING: ROI IN CH CURRENCY VS USD**

Revenue modeling is a critical component of any wealth management strategy. To accurately assess the potential return on investment (ROI) for your clients, you must consider the performance of their investments in both CH (Chinese currency) and USD (United States dollar) terms.

**CH Currency Performance**

The Chinese currency, also known as the Renminbi (RMB), has experienced significant growth in recent years. The RMB has appreciated against the US dollar, making it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to diversify their portfolios. However, it's essential to consider the risks associated with investing in emerging markets, including currency fluctuations and economic uncertainty.

**USD Performance**

The US dollar is a widely traded currency and a popular choice for investors. The USD has historically performed well in times of economic uncertainty, making it an attractive option for those seeking a stable store of value. However, the USD has experienced significant volatility in recent years, making it essential to consider the potential risks associated with investing in a single currency.

**ROI Comparison**

To accurately assess the ROI for your clients, you must consider the performance of their investments in both CH and USD terms. By comparing the returns on investment in both currencies, you can identify opportunities for diversification and optimize your clients' portfolios.

**Example:**

Suppose a client invests $100,000 in a portfolio of Chinese stocks and bonds. Over the course of a year, the portfolio generates a return of 10% in RMB terms, equivalent to $12,000 in USD terms. However, the client also invests $100,000 in a portfolio of US stocks and bonds, which generates a return of 8% in USD terms, equivalent to $8,000 in RMB terms.

By comparing the returns on investment in both currencies, you can identify opportunities for diversification and optimize your clients' portfolios. In this example, the client may consider allocating a larger portion of their portfolio to the Chinese stocks and bonds, as they have generated a higher return in RMB terms.

**Conclusion**

Revenue modeling is a critical component of any wealth management strategy. By considering the performance of investments in both CH and USD terms, you can identify opportunities for diversification and optimize your clients' portfolios. By following this revenue modeling framework, you can ensure that your clients achieve their financial goals and maximize their returns on investment.
