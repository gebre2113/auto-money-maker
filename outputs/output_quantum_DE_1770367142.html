  <li><b>Q: How does a incident response plan work?</b>
  <p>A: An incident response plan works by providing a structured approach to responding to security incidents. It helps to minimize downtime, reduce data loss, and ensure rapid recovery.</p></li>
  <li><b>Q: What is the difference between a vulnerability scan and a penetration test?</b>
  <p>A: A vulnerability scan identifies potential vulnerabilities in an organization's systems and networks, while a penetration test simulates a real-world attack to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities.</p></li>
  <li><b>Q: How does a compliance audit work?</b>
  <p>A: A compliance audit works by evaluating an organization's adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards. It helps to identify areas of non-compliance, and provides recommendations for remediation and improvement.</p></li>
  <li><b>Q: What is the purpose of a risk management framework?</b>
  <p>A: The primary purpose of a risk management framework is to provide a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks. It helps to minimize the risk of security breaches, and ensures that an organization is prepared to respond to security incidents.</p></li>
  <li><b>Q: How does a threat hunting program work?</b>
  <p>A: A threat hunting program works by proactively searching for potential security threats. It helps to identify and mitigate advanced threats, and provides insights and intelligence to improve security posture.</p></li>
  <li><b>Q: What is the difference between a security operations center (SOC) and a network operations center (NOC)?</b>
  <p>A: A SOC is a centralized unit that monitors and analyzes security-related data, while a NOC is a centralized unit that monitors and manages network operations.</p></li>
  <li><b>Q: How does a cloud security platform work?</b>
  <p>A: A cloud security platform works by providing a comprehensive set of security controls and features to protect cloud-based resources. It helps to ensure the security and integrity of cloud-based data and applications.</p></li>
  <li><b>Q: What is the purpose of a data loss prevention (DLP) system?</b>
  <p>A: The primary purpose of a DLP system is to prevent sensitive data from being lost, stolen, or compromised. It helps to identify and mitigate potential data breaches, and ensures that sensitive data is protected and secure.</p></li>
  <li><b>Q: How does a endpoint detection and response (EDR) system work?</b>
  <p>A: An EDR system works by monitoring and analyzing endpoint activity to detect and respond to potential security threats. It helps to identify and mitigate advanced threats, and provides insights and intelligence to improve security posture.</p></li>
