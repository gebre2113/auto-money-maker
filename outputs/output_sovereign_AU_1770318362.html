**CHAPTER 2: Revenue Modeling: ROI in AU Currency vs. USD**

As a Wealth Strategy Expert, understanding revenue modeling is crucial for making informed investment decisions. In this chapter, we'll explore revenue modeling and calculate ROI in both AU currency and USD.

**Revenue Modeling**

Revenue modeling involves forecasting future revenue streams and calculating the return on investment (ROI) for various investment opportunities. To create a revenue model, we'll need to consider the following factors:

1. **Revenue streams:** Identify the sources of revenue, including interest income, dividend income, and capital gains.
2. **Growth rate:** Estimate the growth rate of each revenue stream.
3. **Costs:** Calculate the costs associated with generating each revenue stream.
4. **Tax implications:** Consider the tax implications of each revenue stream.

**ROI Calculation**

To calculate ROI, we'll use the following formula:

ROI = (Net Profit / Total Investment) x 100

Where:

* Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Costs
* Total Investment = Initial Investment + Any Additional Investments

**AU Currency vs. USD**

To calculate ROI in both AU currency and USD, we'll need to consider the current exchange rate between the two currencies. As of January 2026, the exchange rate is approximately 1 AUD = 0.65 USD.

**Example**

Let's consider an investment opportunity that generates the following revenue streams:

* Interest income: 5% per annum, AU$100,000 per year
* Dividend income: 4% per annum, AU$80,000 per year
* Capital gains: 8% per annum, AU$120,000 per year

We'll assume a growth rate of 5% per annum for each revenue stream and a cost of AU$10,000 per year to generate each revenue stream.

**ROI Calculation (AU Currency)**

1. **Interest income:**
	* Total Revenue = AU$100,000 per year
	* Total Costs = AU$10,000 per year
	* Net Profit = AU$90,000 per year
	* ROI = (AU$90,000 / AU$100,000) x 100 = 90%
2. **Dividend income:**
	* Total Revenue = AU$80,000 per year
	* Total Costs = AU$10,000 per year
	* Net Profit = AU$70,000 per year
	* ROI = (AU$70,000 / AU$80,000) x 100 = 87.5%
3. **Capital gains:**
	* Total Revenue = AU$120,000 per year
	* Total Costs = AU$10,000 per year
	* Net Profit = AU$110,000 per year
	* ROI = (AU$110,000 / AU$120,000) x 100 = 91.67%

**ROI Calculation (USD)**

1. **Interest income:**
	* Total Revenue = AU$100,000 per year / 0.65 = USD$153,846 per year
	* Total Costs = AU$10,000 per year / 0.65 = USD$15,385 per year
	* Net Profit = AU$90,000 per year / 0.65 = USD$138,461 per year
	* ROI = (USD$138,461 / USD$153,846) x 100 = 90.16%
2. **Dividend income:**
	* Total Revenue = AU$80,000 per year / 0.65 = USD$123,077 per year
	* Total Costs = AU$10,000 per year / 0.65 = USD$15,385 per year
	* Net Profit = AU$70,000 per year / 0.65 = USD$107,692 per year
	* ROI = (USD$107,692 / USD$123,077) x 100 = 87.45%
3. **Capital gains:**
	* Total Revenue = AU$120,000 per year / 0.65 = USD$184,615 per year
	* Total Costs = AU$10,000 per year / 0.65 = USD$15,385 per year
	* Net Profit = AU$110,000 per year / 0.65 = USD$169,231 per year
	* ROI = (USD$169,231 / USD$184,615) x 100 = 91.73%

As you can see, the ROI calculation in both AU currency and USD yields similar results. However, the ROI in AUD is slightly higher due to the exchange rate.
