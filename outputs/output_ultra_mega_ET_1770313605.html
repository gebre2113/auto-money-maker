**CHAPTER 1: High-Level Technical Architecture & Infrastructure in ET**

### Overview

The high-level technical architecture and infrastructure in ET (Ethereum-based ecosystem) are designed to support the scalability, security, and usability of AI-driven digital wealth and global automation solutions. This architecture is built upon a modular and extensible framework, allowing for seamless integration of new technologies and services.

### Key Components

1. **Blockchain Network**: The Ethereum blockchain serves as the foundation for the ET ecosystem, providing a decentralized and immutable record of transactions and smart contracts.
2. **Node Architecture**: A network of nodes is responsible for validating transactions and executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These nodes are divided into two categories:
 * **Full Nodes**: These nodes store the entire blockchain and validate transactions.
 * **Lightweight Nodes**: These nodes connect to full nodes to access the blockchain and validate transactions.
3. **Smart Contract Platform**: The ET ecosystem utilizes the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to execute smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code.
4. **Decentralized Application (dApp) Platform**: The ET ecosystem provides a platform for developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on top of the Ethereum blockchain.
5. **Oracles**: Oracles are services that provide real-world data to smart contracts, enabling them to make informed decisions based on external factors.
