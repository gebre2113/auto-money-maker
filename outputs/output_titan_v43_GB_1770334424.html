**3. 30 Complex Technical FAQs**

### 3.1 What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?

Supervised machine learning involves training a model on labeled data, whereas unsupervised machine learning involves training a model on unlabeled data.

Supervised machine learning is used for tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The model is trained on a dataset that is labeled with the correct output, and the model learns to predict the output for new, unseen data.

Unsupervised machine learning, on the other hand, is used for tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. The model is trained on a dataset that is not labeled, and the model learns to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
