**CHAPTER 2: Revenue Modeling: ROI in AU currency vs USD**

Revenue modeling is a crucial aspect of any business, and it's essential to understand how to calculate returns on investment (ROI) in both Australian dollars (AUD) and US dollars (USD).

**Calculating ROI in AUD**

To calculate ROI in AUD, you need to follow these steps:

1. Identify your revenue streams, including sales and investments.
2. Calculate your total revenue in AUD.
3. Calculate your total costs, including expenses and taxes.
4. Calculate your net income in AUD.
5. Calculate your ROI by dividing your net income by your total revenue.

Example:

* Total revenue in AUD: $100,000
* Total costs in AUD: $50,000
* Net income in AUD: $50,000
* ROI: 50% ($50,000 ÷ $100,000)

**Calculating ROI in USD**

To calculate ROI in USD, you need to follow these steps:

1. Convert your AUD revenue and costs to USD using the current exchange rate.
2. Calculate your total revenue in USD.
3. Calculate your total costs in USD.
4. Calculate your net income in USD.
5. Calculate your ROI by dividing your net income by your total revenue.

Example:

* Total revenue in AUD: $100,000
* Exchange rate: 1 AUD = 0.75 USD
* Total revenue in USD: $75,000
* Total costs in AUD: $50,000
* Exchange rate: 1 AUD = 0.75 USD
* Total costs in USD: $37,500
* Net income in USD: $37,500
* ROI: 50% ($37,500 ÷ $75,000)

**Comparing ROI in AUD and USD**

When comparing ROI in AUD and USD, it's essential to consider the exchange rate and its impact on your revenue and costs. A strong AUD can increase your revenue in AUD, but it may also increase your costs in AUD. Conversely, a weak AUD can decrease your revenue in AUD, but it may also decrease your costs in AUD.

To compare ROI in AUD and USD, you need to calculate your ROI in both currencies and then compare the results. If your ROI is higher in AUD than in USD, it may be better to focus on your AUD revenue streams. If your ROI is higher in USD than in AUD, it may be better to focus on your USD revenue streams.

**Conclusion**

Revenue modeling is a crucial aspect of any business, and it's essential to understand how to calculate returns on investment (ROI) in both Australian dollars (AUD) and US dollars (USD). By following the steps outlined above, you can calculate your ROI in both currencies and compare the results to make informed decisions about your business.
