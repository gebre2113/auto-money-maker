            **Phase 2: Global Digital Dominance - The 2026 DE Strategy**

**Executive Summary**

As we embark on Phase 2 of our 2026 Digital Excellence (DE) strategy, we will focus on establishing a robust technical architecture, setting up a scalable infrastructure, and implementing a local resource scaling approach. These key components will enable us to solidify our position as a global digital leader, guaranteeing seamless execution and growth in the years to come.

**Technical Architecture**

Our technical architecture will be designed to support a hybrid cloud model, leveraging the strengths of on-premises infrastructure, public cloud services, and edge computing. This approach will provide flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, allowing us to adapt to changing business needs.

**1. Hybrid Cloud Model**

* **On-premises Infrastructure**: We will maintain a dedicated on-premises data center to host critical workloads, sensitive data, and high-security applications. This will ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain data sovereignty.
* **Public Cloud Services**: We will utilize public cloud services from leading providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) to host scalable applications, development environments, and data storage. This will enable rapid deployment, elasticity, and cost savings.
* **Edge Computing**: We will implement edge computing solutions to support IoT, real-time analytics, and content delivery networks (CDNs). This will reduce latency, improve performance, and enhance user experience.

**2. Microservices Architecture**

To ensure agility, scalability, and maintainability, we will adopt a microservices architecture. Each microservice will be designed to perform a specific function, allowing for:

* Independent deployment and scaling
* Simplified testing and debugging
* Reduced coupling and increased fault tolerance
* Enhanced reusability and modularity

**3. API-First Approach**
