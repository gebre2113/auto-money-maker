    <p>A: A CNN is a type of deep learning model that involves using convolutional and pooling layers to process and transmit information. CNNs are often used in applications such as image recognition and object detection. An RNN, on the other hand, is a type of deep learning model that involves using recurrent connections to process and transmit information. RNNs are often used in applications such as language modeling and speech recognition.</p></li>

    <li><b>Q: How does attention mechanism differ from traditional neural network models?</b>
    <p>A: The attention mechanism is a technique used in deep learning models to focus on specific parts of the input data that are relevant to the task at hand. Attention mechanisms can help to improve the performance and efficiency of deep learning models, and are often used in applications such as language translation and question answering. Traditional neural network models, on the other hand, involve the use of a fixed set of weights and biases to process and transmit information.</p></li>

    <li><b>Q: What is the purpose of batch normalization in deep learning?</b>
    <p>A: The purpose of batch normalization is to normalize the inputs to each layer of a deep learning model, and to reduce the effect of internal covariate shift. Batch normalization can help to improve the stability and speed of training, and can be used to improve the performance of deep learning models.</p></li>

    <li><b>Q: How does dropout differ from traditional regularization techniques?</b>
    <p>A: Dropout is a technique used in deep learning models to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out units during training. Dropout can help to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models, and can be used to reduce the risk of overfitting. Traditional regularization techniques, on the other hand, involve adding a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights and prevent overfitting.</p></li>

    <li><b>Q: What is the difference between a generative model and a discriminative model?</b>
    <p>A: A generative model is a type of deep learning model that involves learning to generate new</div>
